 This case study involves the development of a Parcel Management App using Flutter. The application allows users to store, collect, and view parcels through a web app interface.

 The application is divided into several Dart files, each with a specific purpose:

   main.dart: This is the entry point of the application. It sets up the Flutter environment and launches the initial screen of the app.

   storage.dart: This file defines the storage system for the parcels. It includes the logic for storing and retrieving parcels.

   parcel.dart: This file defines the Parcel class, which represents a parcel in the system. Each parcel has a sender and a house number.

   parcel_management_system.dart: This file defines the ParcelManagementSystem class, which is the main class that controls the application. It uses the classes defined in storage.dart and parcel.dart to manage the parcels.

 The application uses Flutter's widget system to create the user interface. It includes form inputs for the user to enter data and buttons to trigger actions. The application also uses Flutter's state management system to update the interface when the data changes.
